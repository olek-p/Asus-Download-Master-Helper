This simple tool connects to an ASUS router running the Download Master app. The features so far:
- add a new torrent by link (magnet links accepted)
- check the list of current downloads and remove the finished ones, plus send a
  notification email
- periodically check for new episodes of TV shows and add them to the download
  list

The latter two are meant to be configured in a crontab. The config options include setting the address where your Download Master is running and the email address the notifications are sent to.

TODO
- as the whole thing is just a simple tool I wrote to save me some headaches, I
  would need to make it more user-friendly and configurable, as I imagine not everybody follows the same TV shows as me
- it's also not very idiot-proof; some sanity checks here and there would be
  nice
